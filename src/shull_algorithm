for the sweep hull algorithm given here. The author would like
to acknowledge material support form RedGate.com a genuinely enlightened

4. find the point xk that creates the smallest circum-circle with x0 and xj
and record the center of the circum-circle C.

5. order points [x0, xj, xk] to give a right handed system: this is the initial
seed convex hull.

6. resort the remaining points according to |xi − C|**2 to give points si

7. sequentially add the points si to the porpagating 2D convex hull that is
seeded with the triangle formed from [x0, xj, xk]. as a new point is added the facets of the 
2D-hull that are visible to it form new triangles.

8. a non-overlapping triangulation of the set of points is created. 
(This is an extremely fast method for creating an non-overlapping triangualtion of a 2D point set).

9. adjacent pairs of triangles of this triangulation must be ’flipped’ to 
create a Delaunay triangulation from the initial nonoverlapping triangulation.
